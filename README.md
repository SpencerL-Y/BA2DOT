# BA2DOT

## Introduction

This is a automata format converter from BA to DOT written in Java  in order to make use of the visualization of graphviz.

BA format is defined by RABIT.

## History

- 2018.1.29	Xie Li 	 Start the project
- 2018.1.30	Xie Li	 Finished BA to DOT programming and run some example successfully.

## Note
This tool is now very naive and simple, can only solve BA2DOT. Besides, the program is not fully tested, so there might be some hidden bugs.

Further works including refactoring the codes and adding other formats like  HANOI.
